"King Dubby" Dub siren module PCB ideas and design repository
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features and design elements:

Oscillator and lfo connected internally
-two or three pots for rate, intensity (lfo modulation) and volume (VCA pre or post FX)

Envelope trigger button and trigger input
	-trigger would have a internal envelope at a fixed AR time setting

VCA 
	-Pre/Post effect switch that switches between VCA ch. 1 and 2 (input/postVCA+ENV)

Simple delay + reverb that has a static or single potentiometer parameter

Mixer - 3 channels
	- input level for line-in level mic (dry)
	- post VCA+ENV
	- delay (wet)
 
Universal design of PCB for every format (euro, dotcom, kosmo, guitar pedal)

Three or more potentiometers hold the pcb to the faceplate
